/// The Mini Panel (spec v1): Atd's always-there quick entry on a screen edge. A Liquid Glass pill
/// rests against the left or right edge of one display's work area; a click on it (or, set to
/// open on hover, pointing at it) opens a capsule of quick actions, which can be dragged anywhere
/// and springs to the nearest edge on release; a drag of files, images, text or links anywhere on
/// screen turns it into a drop target whose drop joins the task panel's current draft and is
/// never sent by itself.
///
/// This is the one owner of the panel's state machine (``MiniPanelPhase``), its window
/// (``MiniPanelWindow``), its motion (motion-v2) and its settings (``MiniPanelSettings``). Its
/// controls and drops reach the shell's existing flows through ``Actions``. The shown setting
/// has its one owner here: the bridge, the menus and the context menu all change it through
/// ``setShown(_:)``. Extensions own the layout on the display (`+Layout`), the choreography of
/// each change (`+Choreography`), the pointer and the response logs (`+Pointer`), the hover label
/// (`+Label`), dragging and snapping (`+Motion`), and drag sessions and drops (`+Drop`); the
/// state they share is internal only for them. Nothing is written to the model while anything
/// moves (perf-v1): changes set targets and animations once, and SwiftUI runs them.
