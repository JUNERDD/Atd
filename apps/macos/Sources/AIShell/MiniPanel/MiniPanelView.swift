/// material and merge as they emerge from one another. The container covers only where glass can
/// be (``MiniPanelLayout/glassRegion``), never the whole transparent canvas.
///
/// Nothing here is written while it moves: every value carries its own animation and the views
/// apply them as scoped animations, so SwiftUI interpolates them and each axis, factor and look
/// keeps its own curve whichever change redraws it. Each piece is drawn in a fixed lane, and its
/// glass, its clip and the content riding inside it all take one animated value, so each frame of
/// an animation updates only render effects, never a layout or a view body, and the content can
/// never drift outside its glass. Buttons and rows sit plain on the glass with neutral washes,
/// never glass on glass; a state shows through shape and content alone.
///
/// No piece carries a `glassEffectID`: none is ever inserted or removed, so no glass transition
/// has anything to match; the container blends the pieces by their distance alone.
