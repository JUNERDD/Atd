/// window server passes clicks and drags on its transparent pixels to the windows below, so only
/// the drawn glass takes them (which is why it never sets `ignoresMouseEvents`, which would make
/// every pixel take them). It floats one level above a pinned task panel, below menus and the

/// cycle or the Windows menu, and draws no shadow of its own: the glass draws its own.

/// A left press on the drawn panel is held here rather than given to SwiftUI, as

/// ``MiniPanelMetrics/moveThreshold``, the window follows the pointer 1:1 and reports the drag's
/// samples on release (``onDragEnded``), and the owner snaps it to an edge. A press that travels
/// no further is a click: one the owner takes itself (``onClick``, the tucked pill's, which opens
/// it) ends there, and any other is posted again, press and release, and passes through to SwiftUI
/// in order. A press on the commands card that travels further is no click at all, and one on its
/// scrollbar is the scrollbar's own: it goes down, moves and comes back up through
/// ``onScroller``, and is never replayed. A right click or a control-click opens the context
/// menu. Pins resize from their corners and report frames,
/// so this keeps its own, smaller version of their press handling rather than sharing it.
