/// The selection toolbar's Accessibility check (grill decision Q4): whether the frontmost app's
/// focused element has a non-empty selection, and where it is. It asks only for the selection's
/// range, length and bounds, never for the text, which ``SelectionReader`` reads only when the
/// user picks a toolbar action.
///
/// - Every AX message is bounded by a 100 ms messaging timeout set on each element it asks
///   (never on the system-wide element, which would change the default of every read).
/// - A secure text field answers ``SelectionProbe/secureField`` before anything else is asked.
/// - `AXSelectedTextRange` first; web content (WebKit, Chromium) reports its selection as a
///   text-marker range, whose length and bounds it answers without the text.
/// - Electron and Chromium build their web tree only once an assistive tool asks the
///   application something (``wakeWebContent(_:)``), so each probe does, and
///   ``prepare(pid:bundleURL:)`` does it ahead of time when an Electron app comes forward.
///
/// Blocking; call it off the main thread.
