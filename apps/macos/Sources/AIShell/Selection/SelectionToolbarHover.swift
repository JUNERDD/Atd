/// areas lag behind the pointer. Instead, while the toolbar shows, this reads the pointer on
/// every display frame, washes the button under it and shows the pointing hand there, or the
/// open hand over the drag handle (``BackgroundCursor`` lets an inactive app set the cursor).
///
/// It is the one owner of the wash and the cursor across the toolbar's windows: the capsule's
/// buttons (``start(_:grip:in:)``) and, while it is open, the More menu's rows (``add(_:)``,
/// ``remove(_:)``), so no second tracker ever sets the cursor against it.
///
/// The frame callbacks pause once the pointer has rested away from those windows for
/// ``idleFrames``; the next move over another app (seen by the controller's monitor) resumes
/// them before the pointer can reach the toolbar or its menu, so hover never waits on a frame.
